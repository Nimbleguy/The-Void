The Void
========

My mod, The Void.
The void is a mysterious place filled with all kinds of magic. There is ancient lore left, and even some mythology.  There is more out there then just the uninhabitable void under the overworld. There is an entire world of mysteries to be discovered.
This is my first released mod, and it is about doing magic related to the void, using knowledge given to you by ancient civilizations that have since died out.
